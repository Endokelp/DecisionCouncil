name: council
description: >-
  Run a structured multi-agent debate (Scout, Advocate, Skeptic, Fact Checker) for
  high-stakes, hard-to-reverse decisions and deliver a ranked recommendation with
  #1 marked and dissent preserved. Use ONLY when the user says council this,
  /council, run the council, pressure-test this, stress-test this, war room this,
  debate this, or explicitly names this skill for an expensive purchase, architecture,
  vendor, or strategy fork. Token-aware. Do NOT use for cheap or easily reversible
  decisions.

# The Council

A disciplined, adversarial decision procedure inspired by [Karpathy's LLM Council](https://github.com/karpathy/llm-council). One **orchestrator** (you, the main session) frames the question, spawns **sub-agents** with distinct lenses, uses **`last30days`** and **`deep-research`** skills only where they earn their tokens, seats a **Fact Checker**, surfaces real disagreement, and synthesizes a **ranked list with a clearly-marked #1** plus the condition that would change the answer.

**Companion skills (install together):** [`last30days`](https://github.com/mvanhorn/last30days-skill) for recent social/web signal; [`deep-research`](https://github.com/199-biotechnologies/claude-deep-research-skill) for claim verification.

## Cursor (primary)

**Install:** `~/.cursor/skills/council/SKILL.md` (run `install.ps1` or `install.sh` from this repo).

**Invoke** — user must name the skill or use a trigger phrase (this skill does not auto-load):

- `council this: <question>`
- `/council <question>` or `/council full <question>`
- `run the council`, `pressure-test this`, `stress-test this`, `war room this`, `debate this`
- `@council` or "use the council skill"

**Sub-agents:** use the **`Task`** tool. Spawn each wave in **one message** with multiple parallel `Task` calls.

| Role | `subagent_type` | `run_in_background` | Notes |
|------|-----------------|---------------------|-------|
| Scout, Advocate, Skeptic, Fact Checker | `generalPurpose` | `false` | Council waves must block until each agent returns |
| Repo/file discovery only | `explore` | `false` | Use when Step 0 needs codebase context, not for debate personas |

**Task prompt template** — give each sub-agent:

1. Step-0 frame (decision, options, constraints, deciding metric)
2. Prior wave output only (not full chat history)
3. Role instructions + word cap
4. "Return ranked top-N + list of factual claims for Fact Checker"

**Example (Advocate + Skeptic in parallel):**

```
Task(description="Council Advocate", subagent_type="generalPurpose", run_in_background=false, prompt="...")
Task(description="Council Skeptic", subagent_type="generalPurpose", run_in_background=false, prompt="...")
```

Do **not** spawn subagents for orchestrator synthesis — that stays inline in the main session.

**Cursor anti-patterns (never):**

- `run_in_background: true` for council waves — synthesis depends on completed persona output
- `explore` for Advocate/Skeptic/Fact Checker — debate personas need `generalPurpose` + web search
- Multiple sequential messages per wave — batch parallel `Task` calls in **one** orchestrator turn
- Passing full chat history into sub-agent prompts — Step-0 frame + prior wave only

**Wave checklist (Cursor):**

```
Lite council:
- [ ] Step 0 frame inline (or 1× explore Task if repo context needed)
- [ ] 1× Task Scout
- [ ] 2× Task Advocate + Skeptic (same message)
- [ ] 1× Task Fact Checker
- [ ] Chairman synthesis inline (no Task)
```

Install via repo: `npx skills add Endokelp/council-skill --skill council -g -y` or `install.ps1` / `install.sh`.

## Claude Code

Works with `/council`. Use the `Agent` tool instead of `Task`; same wave structure and token caps.

## When to use / when NOT to

- **USE** for: expensive purchase, architecture or vendor lock-in, strategy fork, "which of these options" — anything **costly to get wrong or hard to reverse**.
- **DO NOT** use for: reversible, cheap, or low-stakes choices. The council is deliberately heavyweight.

## The research model

Each lens argues from **its own evidence**, not vibes:

1. **Scout** (1 `Task`) — run **`last30days`** when recency/social signal matters, plus lean baseline: option list, current/street prices, headline specs, single deciding metric. ≤ ~600 words, URL per number. No opinion.
2. **Advocate + Skeptic** (2 parallel `Task`s) — each gets frame + Scout baseline; **≤5 lens-specific web searches** for NEW evidence only.
3. **Fact Checker** (1 `Task`) — run **`deep-research`** in **Quick** mode on contested claims. VERIFIED / PARTLY / FALSE / UNVERIFIABLE + cited source. ≤ ~700 words.
4. **Orchestrator** synthesizes inline as Neutral + Pragmatist + chairman — no extra agent.

**Do not** invoke `last30days` or `deep-research` inside Advocate/Skeptic — those personas stay search-light.

## Token discipline (mandatory)

1. **Baseline once, angles many.** Scout establishes shared facts; personas research only their angle.
2. **Cap every sub-agent.** Scout ≤ ~600 words; each persona ≤ ~700 words; Fact Checker ≤ ~700 words. Cite URLs. No preamble.
3. **One round by default.** Personas pre-empt the opposing side's strongest point. Rebuttal round ONLY for unresolved factual conflict — **1–2 agents max**.
4. **Orchestrator absorbs Neutral + Pragmatist + chairman** in lite mode.
5. **Parallelize.** Multiple `Task` calls in one message per wave. Use agent summaries, not full transcripts.
6. **Gather local context once.** Read PRD/repo/files once; distil into Step-0 frame for every prompt.

## Modes

- **LITE (default):** Scout → Advocate + Skeptic (parallel) → Fact Checker → orchestrator synthesis. ~4 sub-agents.
- **FULL** (`/council full` or user says "full council"): Scout → 5 personas + Fact Checker → rebuttal on contested points only → synthesis. ~2–3× lite tokens.

## Procedure — LITE (default)

**Step 0 — Frame (orchestrator, inline).** Read local context once. ≤6 bullets: decision, candidate options, hard constraints, single deciding metric. Paste into every `Task` prompt.

**Step 1 — Scout (1 `Task`).** Invoke **`last30days`** when the decision depends on current social/web signal. Baseline: per-option price/spec/status, conflicts as ranges. ≤ ~600 words, URL per number, no opinion.

**Step 2 — Advocate + Skeptic (2 `Task`s, parallel, one message).** ≤5 lens-specific searches each:
- **Advocate:** strongest case for top 1–2 contenders; pre-empt Skeptic.
- **Skeptic:** adversarial downside; pre-empt Advocate.

Both: ≤ ~700 words, cite URLs, ranked top-N + **factual claims** for Fact Checker.

**Step 3 — Fact Checker (1 `Task`).** **`deep-research`** Quick on claim list. ≤ ~700 words.

**Step 4 — Synthesize (orchestrator, inline).** Fold in corrections. At most one targeted follow-up if a decisive number is still contested. Deliver:
- **ranked list, #1 clearly marked**, one deciding trade-off per option
- **strongest preserved dissent**
- **"the condition that would change the answer"**

## Procedure — FULL (explicit request only)

Same Step 0 + Scout. Then Round 1 (5 parallel `Task`s): Optimist, Pessimist, Neutral Analyst, Pragmatist + Fact Checker on strongest claims. Rebuttal on contested agents only. Synthesis with #1 marked, dissent preserved.

## Output contract

Ranked list with **#1 unambiguous**; each entry one deciding line; main dissent visible; condition that would flip the verdict; honest "no option satisfies all constraints" when true. Chairman tone: decisive, evidence-bound.

## Triggers (explicit invocation required)

| Phrase | Mode |
|--------|------|
| `council this: …` | LITE |
| `/council …` | LITE |
| `/council full …` | FULL |
| `run the council`, `pressure-test this`, `stress-test this`, `war room this`, `debate this` | LITE |
| "use council skill", `@council` | LITE unless user says "full" |
